\section{Assumptions}

The cash flow analysis will consist of computing the present value of the future revenue of all projects that the company will generate in the following $`r t`$ years making the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Risk free annual effective interest rate of Mexican economy: `r y`.
\item Sustained price annual increment ratio of technology: `r r`.
\end{itemize}

The company will work on $5$ types of projects at the same time:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Landing pages,
\item Small projects,
\item Large projects,
\item Enterprice projects, and
\item Inhouse projects.
\end{enumerate}

Each type of project will arrive to the company according to a Poisson point process with a given ratio $\lambda$ per year. In other words, the company will arrange contracts with frequency in such a way that it will have development start points randomly distributed in the timeline with a given average. For example, we will consider that the company will develop an average of $\lambda=24$ landing pages in a year (two each month). We will make these kind of assumptions for each type of project the company wants to develop and the average of contracts in a year will depend on the size of the project.

Inhouse projects will arrive to the company with a ratio of $`r lambda.po`$ per year and will consider the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item The average development time of a project will be $`r average.development.months`$. months. 
\item The revenue generated by an inhouse project will be $\$`r average.monthly.rent`.00$ MNX in average with an standard deviation of $\$`r sd.monthly.rent`.00$ MNX.
\end{itemize}

The positive cash flows that the company will obtain during the following $`r t`$ years due to inhouse projects development will look similar to the following graph:

```{r inhouse projects cash flows graph}
value.inhouse.projects[[3]]
```

Project arrivals to the company will look like the following graph:

```{r inhouse projects arrivals graph}
value.inhouse.projects[[4]]
```

Given the previous future cash flows, the present value of inhouse projects development revenues is worth $\$`r `.00$ MNX.

\section{Valuation}

Considering the previous assumptions the company's value is $\$676,060,485.00$ MNX.
